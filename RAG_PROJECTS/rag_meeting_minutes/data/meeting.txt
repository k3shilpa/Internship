The stand-up meeting was held online on the 10th of January, 2026, with the entire team present. The goal of the stand-up was to quickly align on progress, upcoming tasks, and any risks or blockers before continuing development.

Amith began the stand-up by giving an overall project update. He reiterated the project scope and reminded everyone that the final submission deadline is set for the 30th of January, 2026. He mentioned that the team is currently on track but highlighted that the timeline is tight, so steady progress over the next two weeks is critical. He also confirmed that weekly progress reviews will be conducted and that a code freeze is planned for the 25th of January to allow sufficient time for testing and stabilization.

Shilpa then shared her backend update. She explained that the backend architecture has been finalized and that core API development is currently in progress. She mentioned that initial integration work has started and that no major technical issues have been encountered so far. Her plan for the coming days is to complete the remaining backend modules and focus on full integration by the 20th of January. She noted that timely frontend alignment will help ensure smooth integration.

Sayon followed with his frontend update. He mentioned that the basic UI layout and component structure have been designed and that implementation work has already begun. He explained that the frontend is being developed in parallel with the backend APIs and that placeholder data is being used where necessary. His immediate goal is to deliver a working UI prototype by the 18th of January, after which refinements and backend integration will continue.

Irfana provided an update from the QA perspective. She stated that test planning is underway and that she is currently identifying key functional and integration test scenarios. She emphasized the importance of early testing to catch issues sooner and reduce last-minute defects. She plans to begin writing automated test cases by the 22nd of January and mentioned that backend delays could affect the testing schedule, although no blockers are present at this stage.

Kalidas concluded the updates with the DevOps status. He explained that the deployment approach has been finalized using Docker for the current phase of the project. Work has already started on setting up the Docker-based deployment pipeline, and the initial environment configuration is in progress. He confirmed that the deployment setup should be ready by the 19th of January and mentioned that Kubernetes will be evaluated later once the core system is stable.

The stand-up concluded with a quick check for blockers, and no critical issues were reported by any team member. The team agreed to continue working as planned and to raise any risks early if timelines begin to slip. The next review meeting was confirmed for the 13th of January, 2026, where progress and any emerging concerns will be discussed in more detail.
