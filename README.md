# 🤖 AI-Driven Automated Exploratory Testing using Gauge

## 📌 Overview
This project automates exploratory testing using **Gauge**, enhanced with **AI-driven reasoning and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture** to intelligently analyze web applications and generate dynamic test strategies.

Unlike traditional scripted automation, the system simulates how a human tester explores an application by crawling UI elements, analyzing form behavior, identifying logical constraints, and generating adaptive test scenarios.

The project showcases modern AI-powered QA practices, scalable test architecture, and intelligent automation design.
